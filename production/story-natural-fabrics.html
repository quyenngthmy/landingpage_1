Tencel material is woven from fibers of trees such as eucalypti, eucalyptus, etc.</p><div class="relative w-full pt-[45%]"><img loading="lazy" src="images/story-natural-fabrics-2.jpg" class="image-custom object-contain" alt="Soft, smooth Tencel fabric with good absorbency and attractive colors"></div><p class="italic text-lg text-center">Soft, smooth Tencel fabric with good absorbency and attractive colors</p><p>Common types of Tencel silk on the market include Tencel silk 60s, Tencel silk 80s, and Tencel silk 100s.

This fabric absorbs moisture quite well, with much fewer bacteria present compared to other fabrics, making it very safe for the skin, even sensitive skin.</p><p>Made from natural materials, Tencel fabric is very "green"; it can biodegrade in the soil, so it does not create industrial waste that pollutes the environment. Throughout the production process, no harmful chemicals or solvents are used. Tencel fabric also does not require bleaching agents; it is produced from natural wood pulp. The production process is closed-loop, and excess impurities can be reused.</p><h3 class="font-semibold">Hemp Fabric</h3><p>The fibers from the fiber of the stalks from the hemp plant, an eco-friendly plant that doesn't require pesticides to grow, are used to make hemp fabric. Fabric is woven using only the plant's outer bark as a raw material. Most temperate regions are capable of supporting hemp plants, and the fabric made from them is three times more durable than cotton. These qualities provide hemp fabric clothing the chance to reach its full potential as a material.</p><p>Hemp fabric has a very high durability, ensuring that clothing does not wrinkle or fade during use like other types of fabrics.

Additionally, both growing flax and processing linen fabric require very little water, making the linen industry considered "gentle." Its insulating properties provide a characteristic comfortable feeling: warm in winter and cool in summer. Along with its miraculous absorbency, it prevents body odor from spreading.</p><h3 class="font-semibold">The environment is healthier when fabrics made of natural fibers are used</h3><p>Due to their inherent, compassionate, and environmentally friendly qualities, natural fiber fabrics—as opposed to synthetic ones—are pioneering the movement towards green living and environmental conservation.
